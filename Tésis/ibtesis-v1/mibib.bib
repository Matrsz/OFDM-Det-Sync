@book{chiueh,
	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) access schemes
               are becoming more prevalent among cellular and wireless
               broadband systems, accelerating the need for smaller, more
               energy efficient receiver solutions. Up to now the majority of
               OFDM texts have dealt with signal processing aspects. To address
               the current gap in OFDM integrated circuit (IC) instruction,
               Chiueh and Tsai have produced this timely text on baseband
               design. OFDM Baseband Receiver Design for Wireless
               Communications covers the gamut of OFDM technology, from
               theories and algorithms to architectures and circuits. Chiueh
               and Tsai give a concise yet comprehensive look at digital
               communications fundamentals before explaining modulation and
               signal processing algorithms in OFDM receivers. Moreover, the
               authors give detailed treatment of hardware issues -- from
               design methodology to physical IC implementation. Closes the gap
               between OFDM theory and implementation Enables the reader to
               transfer communication receiver concepts into hardware design
               wireless receivers with acceptable implementation loss achieve
               low-power designs Contains numerous figures to illustrate
               techniques Features concrete design examples of MC-CDMA systems
               and cognitive radio applications Presents theoretical
               discussions that focus on concepts rather than mathematical
               derivation Provides a much-needed single source of material from
               numerous papers Based on course materials for a class in digital
               communication IC design, this book is ideal for advanced
               undergraduate or post-graduate students from either VLSI design
               or signal processing backgrounds. New and experienced engineers
               in industry working on algorithms or hardware for wireless
               communications devices will also find this book to be a key
               reference.},
